                <p>Students are interested and motivated to contribute to your community
                    or open source project in return for mentorship and guidance.
                    We are particularly interested in strong open source projects with motivated
                    contributors who can mentor students.
                </p>

                    <li>Review their Pull Requests</li>
                    <li>Give Students tasks in documentation, bug fixing and feature development</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                    Only open source projects on Github can currently be integrated.
                </div>
                <h3>Communities</h3>
