                <p>Students are interested and motivated to contribute to your community
                    or open source project in return for mentorship and guidance.
                    We are particularly interested in strong open source projects with motivated
                    contributors who can mentor students.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Join as Mentors on the platform</li>
                    <li>Contact admins to approve your community</li>
                    <li>Give Students Karma points for contributing to the community</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For open source projects, we have a more structured approach:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and tag issues on Github which you would like Students to attempt</li>
                    <li>Review their Pull Requests</li>
                    <li>Give Students tasks in documentation, bug fixing and feature development</li>
                </ul>
