                <p>As part of pre-skilling, Students are exposed to business processes,
                    organization and execution of projects, and important tools used at
                    professional organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies and organizations can induct Students via internships or
                    via identified projects/tasks. Tasks can range from 1 week all the
                    way to 3 month projects. Tasks can include surveys, data collection,
                    internal tools development, or even R&D projects.
                </p>
                <p>Companies provide Mentors to the program. Mentors act as representatives of the company,
                guide students during their internships, and grant Karma to students.</p>
